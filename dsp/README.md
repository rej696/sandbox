# Investigating Audio Programing / DSP

The creator of mutable instruments eurorack modules talks about learning audio
programming and DSP here:
https://pichenettes.github.io/mutable-instruments-documentation/tech_notes/education/

In the documentation, its mentioned to read "Understanding Digital Signal
Processing‚Äù by R. G. Lyons, of which I have a copy, and to "learn python and
scipy, write scripts to generate signals, plot their spectrum"

This folder containes code from following a tutorial about using numpy to generate and visualise wav files: https://realpython.com/python-wav-files/

## Setup
Dependencies include:
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
